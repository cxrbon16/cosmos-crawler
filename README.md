This is the crawler project of YTU-CE-COSMOS aiming to collect high-quality monolingual (Turkish in our case) text-data in an efficient way.
The text data we collected with cosmos-crawler gives positive signals as a LLM pretranining corpus.

It is highly recommended to take a look at our Huggingface Account:
